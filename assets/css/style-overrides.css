Commentpress Modern Child Theme Styles

NOTES

The Theme Customizer in Wordpress 3.4 allows quite a lot of changes to be made,
but child themes allow much more to be done. Add styles to this file to override
the style that the parent theme applies.

When you're happy, use a minifier such as <http://www.refresh-sf.com/yui/> to
compress your CSS and paste it into `style-overrides.css`.

BUT...

Before you start editing and wondering why you're not seeing any changes to your
site, you will have to make a small adjustment to your `wp-config.php` file so
that Wordpress chooses this file instead of the minified one. Add this line:

define('SCRIPT_DEBUG', true);

somewhere in your `wp-config.php` file. Remove it when you've updated your
minified file and want Wordpress to select that one instead.
